### About Me

The desire to constantly develop and grow led me to study front-end development.At the moment, I have successfully completed training in front-end development and I will be glad to get the opportunity to do an internship or get a job as a junior front-end developer.

I am not afraid of difficulties, I love learning new things with great interest, I donâ€™t put off until tomorrow what can be done today, I approach the tasks with great responsibility, I easily find contact with people, so I can work in a team without any problems.

I am very motivated to improve my skills on real interesting projects, and at the moment, I continue to improve and expand my knowledge (I study various tutorials on YouTube, I take training in RSSchool, and I am in the process of developing my application using basic knowledge of Node.js/Express/PostgreSQl/React) for a full stack developer position in the future. I also improve my English language skills through tutoring.
